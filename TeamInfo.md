## Project Summary

We intend to build a web app called WeTube to help users organize and analyze their playlist. Based on their preferences, we also enabled features like “trending” to recommend similar videos and “friends” to allow users to add each other. 

To use WeTube, users need to have an account. Once logged in, the app will recommend trending videos based on users' playlist habits. Users can click the recommended video for further details and even add it to the playlist. In the User Dashboard, users can view all its playlists and several charts visualizing its playlist. In the friend page, the app will recommend other accounts sharing the same video preferences.
